Issue priority helps you identify and address critical errors impacting your application's functionality and user experience. By assigning a priority level to each issue, Sentry can surface the most pressing matters first, allowing your development team to focus on resolving impactful problems efficiently.

## How Priority Works

There are three discrete priority levels for issues in Sentry:

- **High**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require immediate attention.
- **Medium**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require attention in the near future.
- **Low**: Issues that do not require immediate attention.

### Priority Assignment on Issue Creation

When Sentry receives an event, it assigns a priority to the issue based on the event's log level (for error issues) or severity (non-error issues like performance). If the event's severity is high or the log level is `error` or `fatal`, the issue is assigned a high priority. If the severity is medium or the log level is `warning`, the issue is assigned a medium priority. If the severity is low or the log level is `info` or `debug`, the issue is assigned a low priority.

### Automatic Priority Updates

Sentry continuously monitors the volume of events for each issue. If an issue experiences a surge in occurrences (escalates), its priority will be automatically bumped to reflect its growing significance. See the [escalating issues algorithm](/product/issues/states-triage/escalating-issues/) for more details on how escalations are identified.

When an issue is no longer escalating, its priority will revert to the previous level.

### Manual Priority Updates

You can manually update the priority of an issue at any time, either from the issue details page or from the issue stream. Once an issue's priority has been manually updated, it will no longer be automatically adjusted based on event volume.

## Priority in the Issue Stream

By default, the issue stream filters out low-priority issues. If you would like to see low-priority issues by default, you can [set your default search](/product/reference/search/saved-searches/#set-a-default-search) to include them.

When viewing the "Prioritized" tab, you can quickly triage issues by using the priority dropdown. You may also update priority of multiple issues at once by selecting them and using the bulk action dropdown. Low-priority issues will disappear from the "Prioritized" tab once their priority is updated.
